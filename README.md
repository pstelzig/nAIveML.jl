# nAIveML.jl

## Scope
nAIveML.jl is a project to experiment with some language features of the Julia programming language while implementing some basic concepts from machine learning and deep learning. It has a purely educational purpose, and as such is mostly self-contained. 

## Background and literature
To understand the mathematical concepts used here, I recommend Yaser Abu-Mostafa's well-known lecture "Learning from Data" from 2012. As software concepts are concerned, of course knowing the Julia language is best, but having any programming background in languagues used in scientific computing -- like C, C++ or Python -- is completely sufficient.
